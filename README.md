For HKU FINA2390 Course

An upload of all my code for various assignments. I recommend not copying this since it's not that efficient, and you may risk plagiarism (if you take the same course).

Data Transformation: Convert deal level data to quarter level data

HK Property: Web scraped property prices and extra information in Hong Kong. Added an option for user filtering that outputs a csv file (that is not perfect)

Pandas_Function: Web scraped 7-11 and Circle K locations in Hong Kong Island and plot them on a map. Allowed user to find the closest competing convenience store location, plot it on a map, and compare opening hours.
